1.1 Functional Requirements

FR-1
The platform SHALL host containerized services using an industry-standard container runtime.

FR-2
The platform SHALL support stateful workloads with persistent data surviving container restarts.

FR-3
The platform SHALL allow services to be deployed, stopped, and updated without full platform downtime.

FR-4
The platform SHALL continue operating in a degraded but predictable state upon failure of a single node.

FR-5
The platform SHALL expose health, performance, and resource metrics for all running services.

FR-6
The platform SHALL allow a single operator to perform deployment, troubleshooting, and recovery tasks using documented procedures.

1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1 (Operability)
A new operator SHALL be able to understand system architecture and operational procedures using repository documentation alone.

NFR-2 (Reliability)
Loss of a single node SHALL NOT result in total service outage, though reduced functionality is acceptable.

NFR-3 (Performance)
The monitoring system SHALL refresh metrics at least every 15 seconds.

NFR-4 (Scalability)
The design SHALL allow additional nodes or services to be added with minimal reconfiguration.

NFR-5 (Simplicity)
The system SHALL avoid unnecessary orchestration complexity where simpler solutions meet requirements.

NFR-6 (Cost Constraint)
The platform SHALL run on commodity hardware without specialized networking or storage equipment.

### 1.3 Explicit Out-of-Scope Items

OS-1: Multi-datacenter replication  
OS-2: Zero-data-loss guarantees during catastrophic failure  
OS-3: Automated cloud-style autoscaling  
OS-4: Enterprise backup solutions  
Rationale: These features were intentionally excluded to prioritize operability, clarity, and constrained-resource realism.

2. Intentional Ambiguities 
These ambiguities were intentionally documented to reflect incomplete stakeholder input and to prevent implicit design assumptions from going unchallenged.

2.1 Known Ambiguities

Acceptable Data Loss Window

Requirement states persistence, but does not specify RPO.

Assumption: brief data unavailability is acceptable during node failure.

Failure Detection Thresholds

No explicit SLA or alert thresholds provided.

Assumption: defaults based on observed baseline metrics.

Security Model

Environment assumed to be trusted internal network.

No formal authentication or encryption requirements provided.

Growth Expectations

Requirements mention evolution but no scale targets.

Design favors incremental extensibility over upfront scalability.

2.2 Assumptions Made

Single administrative domain

No hostile actors on internal network

Manual recovery acceptable for rare failure events

Storage performance prioritized over redundancy

Design note: Each assumption is documented so it can be revisited as requirements evolve.
