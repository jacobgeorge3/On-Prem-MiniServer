Verbal Requirements (As Provided by Stakeholder)

We need a small, self-hosted platform to run internal services that cannot rely on public cloud infrastructure

The platform must support stateful workloads with persistent data

We’ve had incidents caused by node failures and want the system to degrade gracefully rather than completely fail

Operations should be simple enough that a single engineer can deploy, troubleshoot, and recover the system

Observability is required so failures can be detected before users report them

The environment is resource-constrained and uses commodity hardware

We expect requirements to evolve, so the design should allow incremental improvements rather than a one-time build
